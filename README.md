# ASLBoard
keyboard extension for asl


# Inspiration Behind 
> A lot of us do not think about the fact that how convenient and lucky it is to be able to speak, listen and write. There is a huge number of deaf people who used American Sign Language (ASL) to communicate with their peers, friends, and family. Do you know that although deaf people may have no trouble communicating an idea in American Sign Language (ASL), they have difficulties when it comes to reading the letters because they never learned to connect letters with sounds? On the other hand, children ( 4-10) nowadays use iPads and iPhones to watch what they want, play what they want, but imagine if parents can teach them how to recognize hand gestures as a form of communication, wouldn't that be an awesome way to learn something?

# How this works
> ASLBoard would allow the user to have an easy time chatting with their peers without any barriers.  ASLBoard follows QWERTY format to make it easier typing and whenever the user taps on the asl sign icon, it would translate what that sign meant in the text box automatically. Just install it inside of your device management and add it to your keyboard.
