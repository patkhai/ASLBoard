# ASLBoard
keyboard extension for asl


# Inspiration Behind 
A lot of us do not think about the fact that how convenient and lucky it is to be able to speak, 
listen and write. There are huge number of deaf people who used American Sign Language (ASL) to 
communicate with their peers, friends and family. Do you know that although deaf people may have no 
trouble communicating any idea in American Sign Language (ASL), they have difficulties when it comes to reading 
the letters because they never learned to connect letters with sounds. On the other hand, children ( 4-10) nowadays 
uses iPads and iPhones to watch what they want, play what they want, but imagine if parents can teach them how to recognize 
hand gestures as a form of communications, wouldn't that be awesome way to learn something? 

# How this works
ASLBoard would allows user to have an easy time chatting with their peers or just have a learning experience. 
ASLBoard follows QWERTY format to make it easier typing and whenever user tap on the asl sign icon, 
it would translate what that sign meant in the text box automatically. Just install it inside of your device management and add it
to your keyboard.
